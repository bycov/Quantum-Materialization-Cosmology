# Model Predictions (Future Constraints)

This directory contains observational predictions for the **Quantum Materialization Gravity (QMG)** model.

### Euclid Mock Forecast:
* **File:** `euclid_fs8_mock.txt` — This dataset represents the synthetic $f\sigma_8(z)$ values predicted by the QMG model for the redshift range $0.7 < z < 2.0$, formatted for compatibility with the upcoming ESA **Euclid** mission.
* **Goal:** To demonstrate the unique signature of QMG in the structure growth rate compared to standard $\Lambda$CDM.

These mocks show that $Q_{growth} \approx 0.59$ provides a distinct deviation that Euclid will be able to verify with high precision.
